Hi,

I work with MATLAB Graphics, and enjoy creating useful, or just clever things with it.

I do most of my editing with Emacs, and have large contributions in Emacs, including the CLOS layer, parser generators, project trackers, and more.

When I'm not behind a keyboard, I build catapults and compete in punkin' chunk competitions.  Unfortunately the pandemic caused most of the nearby contents shut down.
